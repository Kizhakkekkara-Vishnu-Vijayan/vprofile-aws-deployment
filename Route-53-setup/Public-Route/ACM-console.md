# Amazon Certificate Manager(ACM) Configuration

- AWS uses ACM which enables us to host a website using https secure connection, if we have a valid certificate.
- For this you have to purchase domain either from AWS Route 53 or other domain providers like Godaddy, Hostinger, etc.
- Once the domain is purchased you can validate the domain using Route 53 Hosted zones.
