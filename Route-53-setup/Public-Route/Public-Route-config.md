# Public Route 53 Hosted Zone Configuration

After purchasing domain using a domain registrar, you need to validate in AWS route53 hosted zone that the domain belongs to you.
When you create a hosted zone you will get 4 name servers in AWS Route53 hosted zone.
You need to add all 4 name servers in Domain registrar(Godaddy).

The validatioin of certificate is done using hosted zone records.
When you create ACM with the name of your purchased Domain, here in my case .*southlake.xyz, you will get a CNAME and CVALUE.

This CNAME and CVALUE generated by ACM needs to be included in the domain registrars(GoDaddy) DNS management section, or in the records section of Route53.

When the CNAME matches with the CVALUE the certificate is validated to be authentic and then the state of ACM certificate is changed from pending to issued.

Now you can use this certificate to launch you website using secure https connection.
